# peft_fine_tuning
The goal of this project is to explore how to implement parameter efficient fine tuning of a foundational LLM from Hugging Face
1. Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
2. Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the pre-trained model
3. Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
